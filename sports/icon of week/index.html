									<p>Cricket may not be too big a sport in this part of the world but leading US publications have       nonetheless paid tribute to retiring Indian superstar Sachin Tendulkar, applauding the veteran batsman for his "supreme" talent and a career lived with soft-spoken integrity and humility.</p>

								<p>"This week, for more than a billion people, the world as they know it effectively comes to an end. The second Test match between India and the West Indies ...will be the last international appearance of one Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar," a Wall Street Journal article titled 'Farewell to Cricket's Little Master' said. An op-ed in the 'New York Times' likened Tendulkar's retirement from cricket to the death of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

								<p>As the moment of his (Tendulkar's) departure looms, the country is in the fevered throes of one last, mammoth celebration, but also on the un-self-conscious brink of mourning," the NYT op-ed piece titled 'Where the Gods Live On ... and On' said. </p>

					<p>Tendulkar has cemented his place in history as one of the greatest sportsmen and holds almost every batting record in the game. His last test match against West Indies will be his 200th. He scored over 15,000 Test runs, 18,000-plus one-day international runs, 51 Test centuries and 100 international                  centuries. His last test match against West Indies will be his 200th.

					<p>The joy of Tendulkar is that he doesn't seem to have changed much between 1989 and 2013. He still unites the game's constituency in admiration, and he still exudes the same sense of soft-spoken integrity-in a quarter-century at the top of the game, he has attracted only the mildest controversy, and only very rarely. He has never even really said anything that you could quote back critically at him," it said. Tendulkar has been accorded the status of god by his millions of fans across the world, an emotion echoed in the NYT op-ed which said "some Indian gods have three heads, or 10 arms.</p>
